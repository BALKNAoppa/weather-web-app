Day and Night Sides: The app divides the screen into two partsâ€”one showing weather data for the day and the other for the night.
Weather Data: Displays maximum and minimum temperatures, weather conditions, and the current date.
Responsive Design: The interface adapts to different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
