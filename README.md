# Weather App

This React-based weather app provides the current weather information for any city. The app uses the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch weather data and displays it based on day and night conditions. The interface features a search bar to allow users to input the city of their choice.

## Features

- **City Search**: Allows the user to search for a city and get the latest weather forecast.
- **Day and Night Sides**: The app divides the screen into two partsâ€”one showing weather data for the day and the other for the night.
- **Weather Data**: Displays maximum and minimum temperatures, weather conditions, and the current date.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **WeatherAPI**: API service used to fetch weather data.
- **CSS**: Styling for the components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for layout and styling.
- **HTML**: The markup language used for structuring the app's content and layout.

## HTML Structure

The app uses HTML to structure the page content. The primary elements include:

- **`<div>` containers**: Used for grouping content and applying CSS styles.
- **`<img>` tags**: Display images for UI elements like icons and backgrounds.
- **`<input>` tag**: The search bar that allows the user to input a city.
- **`<span>` and `<p>` tags**: Used for displaying the weather data like temperatures and conditions.

Although the app is powered by React, the underlying HTML is generated dynamically based on the component structure and state.
