# Weather App

This React-based weather app provides the current weather information for any city. The app uses the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch weather data and displays it based on day and night conditions. The interface features a search bar to allow users to input the city of their choice.

## Features

- **City Search**: Allows the user to search for a city and get the latest weather forecast.
- **Day and Night Sides**: The app divides the screen into two partsâ€”one showing weather data for the day and the other for the night.
- **Weather Data**: Displays maximum and minimum temperatures, weather conditions, and the current date.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
